This project is about "Bank Management System"-->
Where:

User⇒

5.Can check transaction history.                                                                  
6.Can take a loan from the bank at most two times.                                    
7.Can transfer the amount from his account to another user account. if the other account does not exist then show an error message “Account does not exist”.                                                                                                
Note - User can only withdraw and transfer money from his account if he has money in his account.
If a user is unable to withdraw the amount of money he has deposited in the bank, he will get a message that the bank is bankrupt.

Admin⇒                                                                                                                              
Can create an account                                                                        
Can delete any user account                                                              
Can see all user accounts list                                                            
Can check the total available balance of the bank.                            
Can check the total loan amount.                                                       
Can on or off the loan feature of the bank.                                        

After that I have created  a replica system so that an user and an admin can do the above tasks.
